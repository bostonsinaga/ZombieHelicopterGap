# Zombie Helicopter Gap (<a href="https://cocos.com/en">cocos2d-x</a>)

Survive the zombie doom with a helicopter. Shoot every zombie that gets in your way, but don't let it collide with the building.

Fly through a dead city. If you meet a green colored zombie you must shoot it or ignore it. Don't let it enter the helicopter, if so, your helicopter will be infected. But, if you meet an orange colored victim you have to rescue it. Don' t shoot it, if so, you will be punished by the automatic missile.

You are a brave hero. You can rescue the victims.
